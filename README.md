**Churn Prediction Model**

This repository contains code and resources for building and deploying a churn prediction model based on the provided dataset.

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of customer information from a bank, including features such as Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, etc. The target variable, 'Exited,' indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

### Model Building Process

The churn prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The notebooks provide detailed explanations and code for each step in the process.

### Feedback and Contributions

Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the churn prediction model and its documentation.
